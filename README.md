# RandomPasswordGenerator
This is a Random Password Generator Project that the javascript will generate a random password for a user.

It will ask the user to choose which characters does he or she wants. While the user chooes, the user's answer will be validated each time to make sure the user is giving the right input.

With the user's choice/choices, the javascript with display a random password to the HTML page where user can see.

This project has taught me how to manipulate functions and variables, change the scopes of the variables, and how to chain multiple condition statements.
